  utter_corona:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals
      or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory
      infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle
      East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
      The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
      COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.
      This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan,
      China, in December 2019.

  utter_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are \nü§í fever\nüò¥ tiredness\nüí® dry cough\nSome
      patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
      or diarrhea.These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
      become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
      (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around
      1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
      difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
      serious illness.People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
      medical attention.
  utter_spread_info:
  - text: ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.\nüí¶ The disease
      can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth
      which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.\nü•Ñ These droplets
      land on objects and surfaces around the person.\nüëà Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\n‚ÜîÔ∏è
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
  utter_prevention:
  - text: ‚ÑπÔ∏è Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
      Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have
      seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
      in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable
      so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being
      infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions üßº Regularly
      and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them
      with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
      hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. ‚ÜîÔ∏è Maintain at least 1 metre
      (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?  When
      someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
      mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
      droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
      üö´ Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can
      pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
      nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
      ü§ß Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
      you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets
      spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around
      you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. üè† Stay home if you feel unwell.
      If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention
      and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
      National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on
      the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider
      to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you
      and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. üß≥ Keep up to date on
      the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading
      widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  ‚Äì especially if you are an
      older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher
      chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
  utter_treatment:
  - text: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can
      prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any
      medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
      there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
      medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
      findings are available.
  utter_travelling:
  - text: General recommendations for all travellers include üßº Wash your hands frequently
      üëÑ Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose üí™ Cover your mouth and nose with
      your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze ‚ÜîÔ∏è Stay more than 1 meter
      (3 feet) away from a person who is sick üçó Follow proper food hygiene practices
      üò∑ Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing)
      or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Travellers returning from affected
      areas should-\nüå° Self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days and follow national protocols
      of receiving countries. Some countries may require returning travellers to enter
      quarantine. ü§í If symptoms occur, such as fever, or cough or difficulty breathing,
      travellers are advised to contact local health care providers, preferably by
      phone, and inform them of their symptoms and their travel history. For the latest

  utter_food_related:
  - text: There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the transmission route is through person-to-person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
